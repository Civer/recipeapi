# Grab recipes

This browser plugin grabs a recipe from a supported site and saves it in a JSON-ified version of Open Recipe Format. Currently supports only Chefkoch.de.

A page action will appear when browsing recipes on supported sites, allowing you to extract the recipe only from the site and storing it on the local machine. To browse stored recipes, open the sidebar "Recipes".

# Future work

* Add more supported sites.
  * Note: All Wordpress based sites generate the same DOM for recipes.
* Add sync and share functionality via an external website.
* Add functionality to group recipes in "cook books".
